Are you an introvert? Here's why you should be speaking up in class
</span>
</b>

<br>

October 5, 2016 | Shenelle Wilkins, Guidance Counselor

<br>
<br>

Being quiet in class isn't necessarily a bad thing. At least you get out 
of trouble, right? But there will be times when speaking up in class will 
actually be to your benefit. 

<br>

You could be missing out a lot if you choose 
to keep quiet all the time and let your classmates answer all the questions 
for you. 

<br>

How would you learn all the answers to the questions if all of the 
quiet students were put into one class? 

<br>

Here's some advice that can help you out:

<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
1. Don't be afraid to speak out
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>
 
Remember, speaking out is always a good thing. It'll help others 
around you understand you and be better able to communicate with 
you as a result.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
2. Everyone makes mistakes
</span>
</b>
</font> 

<br>
<br>
 
Nobody's perfect. Don't go to class expecting to get all the answers 
right every time your name gets called.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
3. School is a learning environment
</span>
</b>
</font> 

<br>
<br>
  
If you get something wrong, that's okay. What's important is that you
 at least tried to speak up when others around might have been too 
afraid or shy.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
4. The laughter of other students' laughter isn't the end of the world
</span>
</b>
</font> 

<br>
<br> 
 
You might get something wrong and may end up feeling embarrassed 
afterwards. Just  remember that that's all part of the school experience. 
Sometimes you just have to laugh with those around you. A day without 
laughter is one that's wasted.
 
<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
5. Don't feel the need to impress others
</span>
</b>
</font> 

<br>
<br> 
 
The minute you start to do something hoping that someone will notice or 
be impressed, you'll find yourself in ruin. If you're not so worried about
impressing others, you won't stress so much over it and have better 
concentration.

<br>
<br>

<p align="center">

<font size="13">
<b> 
The most important factor in all this is confidence. Don't expect to become
extremely confident in yourself over night. At the same time, don't allow 
yourself to become too overconfident, either. Remember, trying your best and
learning from your mistakes is what school is all about.
