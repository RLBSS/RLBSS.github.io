5 tips on how to kick-start the new school year
</span>
</b>
</i>
</font>

<br>

September 20,  2016 | Jelanie Dyer, Former Student

<br>
<br>

The school year has once again started. For many, this can be a very difficult 
time for many students who once again have to readjust to school life. 

<br>

The Summer vacation is very long and students often return to school feeling very 
disoriented and unorganised for the first month of school. 

<br>

This is a normal feeling but that feeling should not linger on for the rest of the term, 

<br>

or even worse the rest of the year. 

<br>
<br>

The quicker you can get back on your feet, the more productive you will be. 
As a result, school will be less stressful for you the quicker 

<br>

you learn how to manage your time wisely, which is what we'd all like in the 
end: less stress. 

<br>

Here are a few tips that I've personally developed over the years to 

<br>

help me whenever the Summer or Christmas vacation is over:

<br>

1. Schedule important dates and times
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>
 
The image above can teach you one of the greatest lessons you will ever learn. 
Planning ahead can save you lots of time and free you of unnecessary stress
in the future. 

<br>
<br>

2. Carry a folder where you can keep important handouts, tests, assignments and other material
</span>
</b>
</font>
 
<br>
<br>
 
Keeping all your material together in one place makes it easier for you to find what you need when you need it. Students who keep their work scattered all over the place put themselves at a huge disadvantage when it comes to preparing for tests and completing assignments. Sometimes the material you can't find is the one you really needed the most in a particular situation.

<br>
<br>

3. Make your own copies of your timetable
</span>
</b>
</font> 

<br>
<br>

Having a printed copy of your timetable is really important. Write it down in a book somewhere and then print two copies of it. You can place one in your room somewhere where it can be easily see. Remember that folder from tip #2? You can keep the other in that folder and carry it with you at all times. That way, if you're ever in doubt of where you're supposed to be at a certain time, you can always check the schedule that you carry with you.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
4. Make time for yourself to spend doing schoolwork and studying
</span>
</b>
</font>  

<br>
<br>

A problem many students encounter is not having enough time to complete an assignment. Many complain that they don't have enough time. But is that really the case? Time management is an important skill to learn and cannot be stressed enough. Schedule fixed times for yourself to complete all work and assignments. When you have plenty of time to complete a task, you are less stressed, which would increase your productivity.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
5. Be patient
</span>
</b>
</font>   

<br>
<br>

Remember, readjusting to school life won't happen overnight. It takes an incredible amount of self-control and discipline to really develop new habits and erase old bad habits. The most important thing is to never give up and keep up with your new routine as best as you can.
 
Of course, there are other things that you can do to ensure that the rest of the school year is smooth and free of chaos and stress.
