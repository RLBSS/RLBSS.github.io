Our Sports Term is finally here! At this time, all of our best athletes are
expected to be preparing themselves to support their respective houses. 

<br>

For those who are having a hard time, here are a few tips that you can try to 
follow some simple steps and guidelines that every athlete must follow. 

<br>

<b>
Remember, you can always feel free to visit Mr. Collin if you feel like you need
proper training and advice.

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
1. Organize your time wisely!
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>

Remember, you're still a student. As much as it is important for you to devote
time to training and making other preparations, you should still keep in mind
that you still have to commit to your academic success. Take note of all 
important dates for homework and tests as well the time you have to practice
and prepare yourself.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
2. Eat healthy and sleep well
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>

This is the most important time for you to get all the nutrients and sleep as you
can get. It's important that you maintain good health practices so that you can 
be in peak condition for any activity. Eating right is not limited to giving you
energy. It also supplies your body with nutrients that can help your bones, muscles
and other tissues. Getting enough sleep will also help your body to rest up,
helping you to perform better the next time. It is of utmost importance that all 
athletes maintain a balanced lifestyle with proper nutrition and adequate resting periods.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">

<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
3. Always be prepared for failure
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>

All great athletes fail at some point in their lives. Always be prepared for any possible
outcome. Being properly prepared can help you spring back on your feet quickly no matter
what the outcome. More often than not, the possibility of losing is always ignored by
both amateur and professional athletes. Not everyone will be a winner at the end of the
sporting events. Therefore, it is important that all athletes know how to cope with failure
and disappointment. Losing is always a posibility and it should not be seen as the end or
a mental block. Students should view losing as a motivation for devoting more time and effort
into preparing themselves for the next time. Doing so will not only help you in sports but
throughout your entire life. 

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
4. Overcoming your inhibitions
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>

An important skill for every athlete to learn is how to stay calm and cool under pressure.
In doing so, you will be able to focus on the day of the competition and perform better
as a result. Allowing yourself to get too nervous or over-excited just before an important
event can be a distraction and can also put you at a disadvantage. Losing your cool can cause
you to feel pressured and prevent your body from being naturally relaxed. When this happens,
your entire body and performance is affected. If not handled carefully, you may lose the 
competition not because you were not adequately prepared physically, but because you were
not properly prepared mentally. In the end, mental preparation should not be neglected and is just as
important as physical preparation.

<br>
<br>

<font size="16">
<b>
<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman';">
5. Stay positive!
</span>
</b>
</font>

<br>
<br>

No matter what the outcome is, what's important is that you gave it your all at the end of
the day. Accomplishing what you set yourself out to do is one of the greatest feelings you
can have. Don't spend time dwelling on your mistakes to the point when it's the only thing
on your mind. Remember, there will always be room for improvement for the next time. Until then,
it is up to you as an athlete to understand that, while perfectionism is a great trait to have,
it can also be a very destructive force that can take control of your life completely if you
are not careful. Never give up!
